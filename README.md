# Blueprint-AKV-Certificate

Creating a comprehensive solution blueprint for managing client certificates involves several steps and considerations. Below is a detailed blueprint outline that addresses the needs of an organization to manage and use client certificates in a controlled and secure manner. 

### Solution Blueprint: Managing Client Certificates in Azure Key Vault

#### Overview
This blueprint covers:
1. The roles and responsibilities of different functions in the organization.
2. The process of issuing, storing, and renewing certificates.
3. Secure access to certificates for workloads/applications in Azure landing zones.
4. Two deployment options for Key Vault management.

### 1. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Certificate Issuing Team (CIT)**:
  - Full control over the certificate issuance and renewal process.
  - Management of on-premises certificate authority (CA).
  - Management of Azure Key Vault configurations.
  
- **Application Teams**:
  - Consumers of certificates.
  - Management of workloads/applications in Azure landing zones.
  - Access to their specific certificates only.

### 2. Process Flow

1. **Issuance and Storage of Certificates**:
   - CIT uses an on-premises CA to issue client certificates.
   - Certificates are configured to be non-exportable and stored securely in Azure Key Vault.
   
2. **Certificate Renewal**:
   - CIT handles the renewal process.
   - Renewed certificates are updated in the Azure Key Vault.
   
3. **Access Control**:
   - Application identities are granted access to only their respective certificates in Azure Key Vault.
   - Strict RBAC policies ensure that only authorized applications can access their certificates.

### 3. Secure Access in Azure Landing Zones

- Each landing zone is designed according to the Cloud Adoption Framework.
- Application identities are assigned through Azure AD.
- Policies ensure that workloads in landing zones have isolated access to their respective certificates.

### 4. Deployment Options for Key Vault Management

#### Option A: Centralized Key Vault Management

1. **Centralized Key Vault**:
   - CIT manages a centralized Key Vault in a dedicated landing zone.
   - Certificates for different applications are stored in this centralized Key Vault.

2. **Access Delegation**:
   - Application Teams are granted access to specific certificates through Azure RBAC and Key Vault Access Policies.
   - Example Policy: Only Application Identity `AppA` has access to `CertificateA`.

3. **Diagram**:
   ```
   +----------------------------------------+
   | Centralized Key Vault Landing Zone     |
   |                                        |
   | +----------------------------------+   |
   | | Azure Key Vault                  |   |
   | | - CertificateA (AppA)            |   |
   | | - CertificateB (AppB)            |   |
   | +----------------------------------+   |
   +----------------------------------------+
              |                   |
              |                   |
   +----------+--------+  +-------+-----------+
   | AppA Landing Zone  |  | AppB Landing Zone |
   |                    |  |                   |
   | +---------------+  |  | +---------------+ |
   | | Workload/AppA |  |  | | Workload/AppB | |
   | +---------------+  |  | +---------------+ |
   +--------------------+  +-------------------+
   ```

#### Option B: Distributed Key Vault Management

1. **Distributed Key Vaults**:
   - CIT deploys individual Key Vaults into each landing zone as needed.
   - Each landing zone has its own Key Vault managed as a managed service.

2. **Access Delegation**:
   - Each Key Vault is configured with access policies for the respective applications in that landing zone.
   - Example Policy: `KeyVaultA` in `LandingZoneA` only grants access to `AppA`.

3. **Diagram**:
   ```
   +-------------------+  +-------------------+
   | Landing Zone A    |  | Landing Zone B    |
   |                   |  |                   |
   | +-------------+   |  | +-------------+   |
   | | Key VaultA  |   |  | | Key VaultB  |   |
   | | - CertA     |   |  | | - CertB     |   |
   | +-------------+   |  | +-------------+   |
   |    |              |  |    |              |
   |    |              |  |    |              |
   | +---------------+ |  | +---------------+ |
   | | Workload/AppA | |  | | Workload/AppB | |
   | +---------------+ |  | +---------------+ |
   +-------------------+  +-------------------+
   ```

### 5. Detailed Steps

#### Certificate Issuance and Storage

1. **Issuance**:
   - Use on-premises CA to issue the certificate.
   - Ensure certificates are non-exportable.
   
2. **Storage**:
   - Import the certificate into Azure Key Vault using a secure method.
   - Set appropriate Key Vault Access Policies.

#### Certificate Renewal

1. **Renewal**:
   - CIT renews certificates using the on-premises CA.
   - Update the renewed certificates in Azure Key Vault.
   
2. **Notification**:
   - Set up notifications for upcoming certificate expirations.
   - Automate renewal processes where possible.

#### Access Control Configuration

1. **RBAC and Policies**:
   - Use Azure AD to manage application identities.
   - Configure Key Vault Access Policies to restrict access.
   
2. **Monitoring and Auditing**:
   - Enable logging and monitoring for Key Vault access.
   - Regularly audit access policies and certificates.

### Conclusion

This blueprint ensures secure and controlled management of client certificates, providing the necessary flexibility for different organizational structures and needs. By centralizing or distributing Key Vault management, the organization can choose the most suitable approach to meet their requirements while ensuring robust security and compliance.
